## Octokit v4 breaks 
Solved by downgrading and adding babel plugin
"@babel/plugin-transform-class-static-block"
 

## Used Octokit as request
Quite similar to axios but with additional type inference

## Used react native paper as UI component
Another component library

## Used react-query for caching and query
This provided caching layer, query parameter such as infinite search and loading states
